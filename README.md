# Hand-Gesture-AI-Mouse-Control
This project allows you to control your computer's mouse using hand gestures captured by a webcam. The system uses a combination of OpenCV, MediaPipe (via a custom Hand Tracking Module), and Autopy to track hand movements and perform actions like moving the mouse pointer and clicking, based on specific gestures.
